# Back End Capstone: Stealing Home
This is my back-end capstone project for Nashville Software School. This app uses a web-scraper to gather data from ESPN and Baseball Reference based on my fantasy baseball team. Focusing on my specific fantasy baseball league, the data returned includes my team, players available to be added to my team, and the top 300 ESPN rankings for each player.

Each player's data includes their season stats, their current day stats, and the stats of their last five games. This data is collected using a web-scraper that utilizes the Cheerio npm package and NodeJs.

```
